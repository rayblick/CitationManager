 abstract = {The vitality of religion's frustration reduction function is examined in terms of death fear and self-esteem, and the utility of religion in promoting norm adherence is assessed through analysis of the effects of religion on orientations toward the social responsibility norm. Religion is dimensionalized into public and private ritual activity (church attendance and devotionalism), religious experience and religious orthodoxy. Results from a statewide probability sample of males indicate that high levels of frustration are no more prevalent among the nonreligious than among those high in religiosity, but that devotionalism promotes norm adherence.},
