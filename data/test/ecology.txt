 abstract = {This paper articulates the essentially philosophical character of human ecology. The first section argues that the often–noted concern of human ecology for both sustainability and equity is best understood as a concern to help humans implicated in problematic human–environment interactions to identify how to refashion these interactions so as to enable a more sustainable balance between the moral claims of others and their own needs and desires. Human ecology is therefore governed by a unitary practical interest in facilitating a more sustainable balance between virtue and happiness—living well in Aristotle's sense. If this is so, then human ecology must be done, in certain phases of its practice, as philosophy. The second section then illustrates how this general conception applies to and shapes the investigation of a concrete issue—consumption—particularly in first world economies. It also shows how, given this conception of human ecology as philosophy, this issue is not just one important target of investigation alongside others but the central human ecological topic. Finally, the third section argues that human ecology, done as philosophy, also requires grounding in philosophy. Specifically, it needs a general account of what it is to be the rational animals we humans are since only this can give action–guiding content to the idea of living well without tendentiously prescribing any specific form of life. In conclusion, it is argued that the philosophical character of human ecology explains what it means to describe it as a multi-, inter-, trans-, and even adisciplinary fusion of biological and social sciences.},

 abstract = {In recent years the need for ecological literacy and problem solving has increased, but there is no evidence that this need is reflected by increased ecology coverage at institutions of higher education (IHE) across the United States. Because introductory biology courses may serve to direct student interest toward particular biological categories such as ecology, time devoted to topics in these categories within introductory biology courses may be crucial for captivating student interest. In a 2009 survey, members of the National Association of Biology Teachers (NABT) College and University Sections identified 20 topics they considered essential for inclusion in introductory biology courses. The NABT members, acknowledging the importance of ecological concepts, considered two ecological topics essential. The present study evaluated the actual coverage of ecology and other topic categories compared to recommendations and according to location. For this purpose, lecture and lab syllabi were collected from 26 rural, suburban, and urban IHEs from the Mid-Atlantic region. Course content was divided into eight categories, including ecology, and percentages of total lecture and lab time per category were calculated. This actual coverage was compared to the NABT recommendations. Actual coverage of ecology was not significantly different from coverage recommended by the NABT members, whereas cell/molecular/biochemistry and evolution were lower and genetics, development, and taxonomy were higher than recommended. Course content was also compared by location, with no significant effect of institutional location on ecology coverage. We conclude that although students taking introductory biology courses in Mid-Atlantic IHEs are likely to receive the NABT’s recommended coverage of ecology instruction regardless of institutional location, actual ecology coverage has not increased, regardless of the increased need for ecological literacy.},

 abstract = {Human societies, and their well-being, depend to a significant extent on the state of the ecosystems that surround them. These ecosystems are changing rapidly usually in response to anthropogenic changes in the environment. To determine the likely impact of environmental change on ecosystems and the best ways to manage them, it would be desirable to be able to predict their future states. We present a proposal to develop the paradigm of predictive systems ecology, explicitly to understand and predict the properties and behaviour of ecological systems. We discuss the necessary and desirable features of predictive systems ecology models. There are places where predictive systems ecology is already being practised and we summarize a range of terrestrial and marine examples. Significant challenges remain but we suggest that ecology would benefit both as a scientific discipline and increase its impact in society if it were to embrace the need to become more predictive.},

 abstract = {Methodological individualism has a long, successful, and controversial track record in the social sciences. Its record in ecology is much shorter but proving as successful and controversial with so-called individual-based models. Distinctions and debates about methodological individualism in social sciences clarify the commitments of this general, individualistic approach to modeling ecological phenomena and show that there is a lot recommending it. In particular, a representational priority on individual organisms yields a cogent albeit deflationary account of ecological emergence and helps reveal how quite disparate models and theories in ecology might be unified.},

 abstract = {Lawton’s contingency thesis (CT) states that there are no useful generalizations (“laws”) at the level of ecological communities because these systems are especially prone to contingent historical events. I argue that this influential thesis has been grounded on the wrong kind of evidence. CT is best understood in Woodward’s terms as a claim about the instability of certain causal dependencies across different background conditions. A recent distinction between evolution and ecology reveals what an adequate test of Lawton’s thesis would look like. To date, CT remains untested. But developments in genome-level ecology and molecular ecology point in promising directions.},

 abstract = {A subset of members of the Ecological Society of America was surveyed to describe the current status and infer the future state of ecology. Today's modal ecologist is a 55-year-old male professor who uses field observations and experiments to study communities and ecosystems and finds fulfillment in his research. Younger ecologists rely more heavily on laboratory experiments and modeling but obtain satisfaction in field work. If gender-based retention rates equalize, there may soon be as many women as men in ecology — and their interests differ markedly. Women and men report greater fulfillment from teaching and from data analysis/written communication, respectively. These patterns may explain the poor retention of women in the discipline, given the professional emphasis on publications and grants. Such dissonance between personal satisfaction and the missions of employing institutions must be addressed in order to advance the goals of ecology and enhance the diversity of its practitioners.},

 abstract = {In the face of rapid environmental and cultural change, orthodox concepts in restoration ecology such as historical fidelity are being challenged. Here we re-examine the diverse roles played by historical knowledge in restoration, and argue that these roles remain vitally important. As such, historical knowledge will be critical in shaping restoration ecology in the future. Perhaps the most crucial role in shifting from the present version of restoration ecology ("v1.0") to a newer formulation ("v2.0") is the value of historical knowledge in guiding scientific interpretation, recognizing key ecological legacies, and influencing the choices available to practitioners of ecosystem intervention under conditions of open-ended and rapid change.},

 abstract = {Invasion ecology has much advanced since its early beginnings. Nevertheless, explanation, prediction, and management of biological invasions remain difficult. We argue that progress in invasion research can be accelerated by, first, pointing out difficulties this field is currently facing and, second, looking for measures to overcome them. We see basic and applied research in invasion ecology confronted with difficulties arising from (A) societal issues, e.g., disparate perceptions of invasive species; (B) the peculiarity of the invasion process, e.g., its complexity and context dependency; and (C) the scientific methodology, e.g., imprecise hypotheses. To overcome these difficulties, we propose three key measures: (1) a checklist for definitions to encourage explicit definitions; (2) implementation of a hierarchy of hypotheses (HoH), where general hypotheses branch into specific and precisely testable hypotheses; and (3) platforms for improved communication. These measures may significantly increase conceptual clarity and enhance communication, thus advancing invasion ecology.},
