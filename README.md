# **abstractsPy**
This code converts exported citations in a txt file to a wordcloud. Note that the wordcloud module has the ability to do what I have done and I consider it to be a a better place to start. 


*Example file content saved to txt file*
In this example the code would skip this entry because no abstract was include with this citation.
